# Booking Application

## Project Overview

Welcome to my first project! This repository contains a basic application for booking services, developed in collaboration with a team of four members. The project demonstrates essential functionalities of a booking system.

## Features

The application includes features divided according to different user roles:

- **Owner**: Manage properties and bookings.
- **Tourist**: Explore and book available properties.
- **Guest**: Access and review booking details.
- **Guide**: Provide and manage guided tour services.

## Technologies Used

- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: For the user interface.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture**: For a clean separation of concerns and improved maintainability.
